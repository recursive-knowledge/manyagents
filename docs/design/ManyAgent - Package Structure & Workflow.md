## Status

- **Lifecycle:** Blueprint — copy datasmith's scaffolding, do not reinvent.
- **Last reviewed:** 2026-05-19. Follows `ManyAgent - Design Principles.md` (adds §10).
- Derived from the *shipped* `datasmith` mechanics (`Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, `tox.ini`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `src/datasmith/__init__.py`, `update/cli.py`, `.github/workflows/main.yml`, `mkdocs.yml`). The build/CLI/quality/docs scaffolding is itself a reusable artifact — the single highest-confidence thing to inherit, because it already survived a real package.

```

> **Import-name note.** The Overview uses `import oh_my_agent as manyagent`. Pick the *distributed* name (`manyagent` on PyPI), the *import* name (`oh_my_agent`), and the *alias* (`manyagent`) once, in `pyproject.toml` + `__init__.py`, and never derive them as strings elsewhere (datasmith's identity rule). datasmith ships `fc-data` (dist) / `datasmith` (import) — the mismatch is fine and intentional.

## The Makefile is the only interface

datasmith drives *everything* through `make`; humans and CI call the same targets. `make` with no args prints help (auto-generated from `## ` comments; `.DEFAULT_GOAL := help`). Mirror this exactly:

| Target | What it does (datasmith parity) |
|---|---|
| `make install` | `uv sync --all-extras` + `uv pip install -e .` + `pre-commit install` |
| `make check` | assert `uv.lock` matches pyproject; `pre-commit run -a`; `mypy`; `deptry src` |
| `make test` | `uv run python -m pytest --cov --cov-config=pyproject.toml` |
| `make build` | `pyproject-build` wheel via uv |
| `make bank-up/down/status` | local Supabase lifecycle (datasmith's `supabase-*`) |
| `make bank-migrate` | apply `supabase/migrations/` to the local instance |
| *(later, if hosted)* `make web-up`, `make *-tunnel`, `make model-proxy` | the grafana/cloudflare/litellm analogs — name them now, build when hosted |

Rule: if a contributor needs to remember a raw `uv`/`npx`/`docker` incantation, it belongs in the Makefile with a `## ` doc comment.

## Tooling stack (all via `uv`)

- **`uv` for everything**: `uv sync`, `uv lock --locked` (CI gate), `uv run`, `uv venv`. No bare `pip`/`virtualenv`.
- **Build**: `hatchling`, src-layout, `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] packages = ["src/manyagent"]`.
- **Single console script**: `[project.scripts] manyagent = "manyagent.cli:main"` — the *one* entrypoint (datasmith has exactly one: `fc-data = "datasmith.update.cli:main"`).
- **Dependency groups**: runtime `dependencies`; `[dependency-groups] dev` (pytest, pytest-asyncio, mypy, ruff, deptry, pre-commit, tox-uv) and `docs` (mkdocs-material, mkdocstrings). `git+` direct refs allowed (`allow-direct-references = true`) for the agent-CLI/harbor-style deps.
- **Lint/format**: `ruff` + `ruff-format` (line-length 120; enable `S` bandit, `B` bugbear, `A`, `C4`, `SIM`, `I`, `C90`, `UP`, `RUF`, `TRY`, `PGH`; per-file-ignores for `tests/*` and any `templates/`). Pre-commit also runs hygiene hooks (trailing-whitespace, check-yaml/json/toml, merge-conflict).
- **Types**: `mypy` strict (`disallow_untyped_defs`, `no_implicit_optional`, `warn_return_any`), `files=["src"]`, ship `py.typed`.
- **Dead deps**: `deptry src`.
- **Tests**: `pytest` + `pytest-cov` + `pytest-asyncio` (`asyncio_mode = "auto"` — `manyagent` is async like datasmith's runners), `branch=true` coverage, `testpaths=["tests"]`.
- **Matrix**: `tox.ini` py-versions; `[gh-actions]` mapping. Pin `requires-python` to one minor in `pyproject` (datasmith ships `>=3.12`) but keep ruff/tox aware of the lower bound you actually test.

## Package import surface — PEP 562 lazy loading

datasmith's `__init__.py` exposes a flat API (`import datasmith as ds; ds.PR`) **without importing every submodule at startup**, via a package-level `__getattr__`:

- `_SUBMODULES: set[str]` and `_LAZY_IMPORTS: dict[str, (module_path, attr)]`.
- `def __getattr__(name)`: import on first access, cache in `globals()`.
- `def __dir__()`: returns `__all__` for REPL/autocomplete.
- A `if TYPE_CHECKING:` block re-imports everything so mypy/IDEs see the real types; `__init__.pyi` makes the static surface explicit.
- `setup_environment()` loads `manyagent.env` at import (datasmith's `dotenv.load_dotenv("tokens.env")`).

> **Reconciles Design Principles §4.** §4 ("clever dynamic dispatch dies") is about **per-instance** `__getattr__` for hook/method dispatch on models — that pattern was deleted in datasmith. **Package-level** `__getattr__` for lazy import of *known, static* submodules is the opposite: explicit (everything enumerated in two dicts), type-checker-visible, and is exactly what datasmith *kept*. §4 amended to say so; `manyagent` uses package-level lazy loading and forbids instance-level dispatch.

## The single CLI entrypoint pattern

`manyagent.cli:main` mirrors `datasmith.update.cli:main` structurally:

1. `argparse` with a rich `epilog` (datasmith lists pipeline stages; `manyagent` lists commands `start/register/<agent>/end` + slash commands). `RawDescriptionHelpFormatter`.
2. Validate inputs, construct the orchestrator object, hand off. datasmith: build `Pipeline(...)`, `asyncio.run(pipeline.run(...))`. `manyagent`: dispatch to `manyagent.core`/`manyagent.adapters`/`manyagent.distill` — the CLI stays dumb (`manyagent.cli` doc, Principles §4).
3. **Signal handling for child agent processes — directly relevant to `manyagent`.** datasmith installs a SIGINT handler that SIGTERMs (then SIGKILLs on second Ctrl-C) all tracked agent subprocesses, because agents run in `start_new_session=True` and otherwise hang worker threads. `manyagent` *wraps* a live agent under a PTY — it inherits this exact problem. Adopt datasmith's two-stage SIGINT handler in `manyagent.cli` from day one (added to that doc's Operations section).
4. A `preflight` module run as `python -m manyagent.preflight` validating env/bank/keys before real work (datasmith pattern; the Overview already shows the transcript).

## Quality gate / CI

`.github/workflows/main.yml` parity: one `quality` job (`make check`) + one `tests-and-type-check` matrix job (`pytest` + `mypy` across the python matrix) + codecov upload on one version. PRs gate on both. A separate `docs` workflow builds/publishes mkdocs to Pages. `pre-commit` cache keyed on the config hash.

## Docs site

`mkdocs.yml` + `mkdocs-material` + `mkdocstrings[python]`. `docs/design/` is *this* doc set (Overview, `components/`, principles, this file); `docs/guide/` is operational how-tos written **as ops materializes** (Principles §8 — datasmith accreted `remote-access.md`, `monitoring.md`, `model-proxy.md`); `docs/getting-started/` is install+quickstart. The design docs are the *why*; README + an agent-guide (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md) are the operational truth (Principles §3).

## The development workflow (the loop)

```
make install            # once
# edit code + write the test in the mirrored tests/ path (every feature MUST have a test)
make check              # ruff + ruff-format + mypy + deptry + lockfile  — must pass
make test               # pytest + coverage                              — must pass
python -m manyagent.preflight # before any test that touches a live bank/model
# update docs/ if behavior/CLI/schema/architecture changed (Principles §3)
# open PR  → CI runs `make check` + matrix tests → review → merge
```

Adapter contributions are PRs to `src/manyagent/adapters/` (or a `plugins/` dir) reviewed by maintainers (see `manyagent.adapters` — this is the plugin trust model). Schema changes are **new numbered migrations**, never edits to old ones (`manyagent.bank`, Principles §3).

## Decision log

- **2026-05-19 — Created from the shipped datasmith scaffolding.** Adds Design Principles §10 ("the build/CLI/quality/docs scaffolding is a reusable artifact — inherit it"). Reconciled §4 vs. package-level PEP-562 `__getattr__` (different thing; explicitly allowed). Flagged datasmith's child-process SIGINT handling as mandatory for `manyagent` since `manyagent` wraps live agents.
- **2026-06-09 — Added `manyagent.testing`: simulated-conversation scaffolding (dummy Bank / dummy model / dummy agent harness).** `tests/test_e2e.py` and `scripts/simulate_story.py` had each grown private copies of the same three doubles (scripted IO, canned-completion model, fake adapter); a user asked for shared scaffolding so "each test case is a non-trivial unit test" that *simulates a conversation* through the real verbs. `manyagent.testing` ships: `ScriptedIO` / `DummyModel` (queue of canned completions; raises on under-scripted tests) / `DummyAdapter` (the three attributes handlers touch, incl. a no-op `install_skills`), and `Simulation` — a pytest-free context manager that patches exactly the three live-run seams (`_handlers._adapter_for`, `cli._pty_spawn` — the stub *plays a supplied transcript through the real tee → capture → scrub → persist pipeline* — and `distill.resolve._discover_local_model`), sandboxes `MANYAGENT_HOME`, and exposes the verbs as async methods (`start/register/run_agent/self_distill/discuss/cross_distill/inject/end`). The canonical dummy input is the **trial story**, lifted from a real captured session (Bank dump 2026-06-09; the reflection and bundle are the live payloads verbatim, the transcript is reconstructed around the user's verbatim correction — "-91 degrees fahrenheit was the lowest (wind-chill) temp. in alaska" — and the reply is composed for the /discuss leg) — `trial_transcript()/trial_reflection()/trial_reply()/trial_bundle(post_id)/seed_trial_story(bank)`. Fixtures `sim` and `trial_bank` in `tests/conftest.py`; `tests/test_testing.py` (mirror rule) replays the full loop and asserts the utility-level invariants: evidence survives capture, ★ persists, C1 reject leaves nothing, bundles stay verbatim-grounded, curation is content-addressed-idempotent, injection carries knowledge into a NEW session, quarantine refuses before preview, plus two fixture-drift canaries (the reflection must keep passing the *current* discipline). Registered in the PEP-562 surface (`_SUBMODULES` + `__init__.pyi`). Existing `test_e2e.py`/`simulate_story.py` copies left untouched (green tests not churned); migrating them to `manyagent.testing` is an optional follow-up.
