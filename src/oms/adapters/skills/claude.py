"""Claude Code skill + MCP + hooks installer (M11; hooks: M12 groundwork).

Targets per scope:

- ``user``: ``~/.claude/skills/<verb>/SKILL.md`` (4 files, bare-verb dirs) +
  the oms MCP server registered via ``claude mcp add --scope user`` (the
  user-scope MCP file is ``~/.claude.json``, an internal of Claude Code we
  never write directly — the M11.2 lesson) + MERGE two lifecycle hook
  entries into the shared ``hooks`` arrays of ``~/.claude/settings.json``
  (the documented home for hooks). The user types ``/self-distill``
  natively inside Claude Code.
- ``project``: same shapes under ``<cwd>/.claude/`` with
  ``claude mcp add --scope project``.

The MCP server and hook commands use ``sys.executable`` (the python `oms`
itself is running under) so the agent's spawned processes match the
install, even inside a uv-managed venv. ``OMS_SESSION`` is **not** baked
into any config (it changes per session) — the wrapper exports it in the
parent env at PTY-spawn time; the MCP server and hooks inherit it.

# /self-distill — emit one reflection post to the active oms session

Follow this procedure exactly:

1. Call `mcp__oms__self_distill_draft` (pass `guidance=$ARGUMENTS` if the user supplied any).
2. Using the returned `instruction_for_host_llm` (the schema and anti-meta rules) and the live conversation context, draft ONE structured payload with these fields:
   - `load_bearing_assumption` — a concrete primitive (backticked identifier, dotted.path, `call()`, --flag)
   - `evidence` — verbatim from the trace/conversation
   - `evidence_ref` — a packet id, or null
   - `proposed_next` — a concrete next action
   - `predicted_outcome` — a falsifiable prediction
   - `confidence` — "low" / "medium" / "high"
3. Show the draft verbatim to the user with a recommended ★ (high=5, medium=3, low=2).
4. Then call `mcp__oms__commit_post` directly with `kind="reflection"`, the structured payload, and the recommended rating. Do NOT ask a separate "accept?" question — Claude Code's permission prompt on `commit_post` IS the user's single gate; nothing persists unless they approve it.
5. If the user denies the permission prompt or asks for changes, revise the draft and repeat — the Bank stays untouched until an approved commit (C1).

The active oms session is auto-detected from `$OMS_SESSION` or `~/.oms/active`; if neither is set the MCP tool errors and you should tell the user to run `oms start` first.

# /discuss [@packet] [stance] — emit one stance reply

Procedure:

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for a `@<packet_id>` and a stance.
2. Call `mcp__oms__discuss_draft` with `stance=...` and `packet=...` (the @-stripped id, or null).
3. If the tool returns an error ("no related posts"), tell the user to run `/self-distill` first and STOP.
4. Using the returned `instruction_for_host_llm` (which includes the ranked prior posts) and the conversation, draft a reply with the same 5 fields as `/self-distill`, engaging the post named in `reply_to`.
5. Show the draft verbatim to the user, then call `mcp__oms__commit_post` directly with `kind="reply"`, the structured payload, `reply_to=<from draft>`, `stance=<from draft>`. Do NOT ask a separate "accept?" question — the permission prompt on `commit_post` IS the single gate.

# /cross-distill — curate the active goal's posts into a bundle

Procedure:

1. Call `mcp__oms__cross_distill`. The curator runs in the background (uses `OMS_LLM_*` config or an installed agent CLI).
2. If the tool returns `{{"ok": false, "error": "Run /self-distill first!"}}`, tell the user to run `/self-distill` first and STOP.
3. Otherwise, summarize: the `bundle_id`, `scope`, `goal`, and the per-bucket counts. Tell the user they can `/inject @<bundle_id>` to seed a session with this bundle.

The curator is mechanical and idempotent — re-running over the same posts returns the same bundle, no re-spend.

`$ARGUMENTS` may contain `@<packet_id>`. If omitted, the latest non-quarantined distill is used.

Procedure:

1. Call `mcp__oms__inject_preview` with `packet=$ARGUMENTS` (or null).
2. If the tool returns an error (no bundle / quarantined), report it and STOP.
3. Show the preview verbatim to the user, then call `mcp__oms__inject_commit` with the same packet id. Do NOT ask a separate "inject? [y/n]" question — Claude Code's permission prompt on `inject_commit` IS the user's single gate; the ledger row is only written if they approve.
4. If the user denies the permission prompt, STOP — nothing is recorded.
